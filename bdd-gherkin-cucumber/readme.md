## Homework 02

### Task description
The second homework is directly connected to your Homework 01. You will need to implement the steps for your Gherkins.
You will use the same training examples to exercise steps implementation:
https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login
https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/add_remove_elements/
https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/checkboxes
https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/key_presses
https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/status_codes

### Homework requirements
1. You will need to repeat the steps of the framework set up that we did during the Workshop. Make it locally on your laptop, without using Vagrant.
2. Create separate feature files for the each of mentioned examples above. You can use scenarios that you've prepared in Homework 01 => you can update them or add even more tests.
3. Implement the steps for your features. You can use tests used during the workshop as a reference.
4. Add possibility to run different specs(feature files).
